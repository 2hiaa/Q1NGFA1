    <p> Vladimir Makarov is the leader of the ultranationalist organization and Imran's protege. 
    He is the MAIN villain in call of duty. <br> However, he is more than 
    just these titles though, he is a master manipulator and very skilled when it comes to strategization. <br> When you 
    are the main character and think that you are ahead, he WILL ALWAYS BE 20 steps ahead.
